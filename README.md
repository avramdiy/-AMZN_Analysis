## STOCK ANALYSIS

- Analysis of $AMZN (Amazon)

- Link to Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etf

### 1st Commit

- Uploaded amzn.us.txt to a HTML dataframe for cleaning and initial analysis.

### 2nd Commit

- Corrected README.md.txt to README.md file

- Drop the "OpenInt" column

- Only keep rows that are dated from 1998-01-01 to 1998-11-10

- Only keep rows that are dated from 2008-01-01 to 2008-11-10

### 3rd Commit

- Adjusted name of filtered data dataframe

- Created a new route and plot to define two line plots, showing the monthly aggregate "Open" price for 1998 & 2008.

- Plot looks good, but I want the X-axis to show January through December, with both line plots shown over the same time frame.

- Chart is corrected. Good to see a comparison, but there is not much correlation between the sets of data.

### 4th Commit

- Create a new plot and route, but for the monthly aggregate "Close" price of 2008 & 1998. "/closeplot"

- Rename /plot to /openplot

### 5th Commit

- Create a new plot & route using the "High" & "Low" prices of 2008 & 1998, to create four line plots showing the monthly "High" and "Low" price points for the years of 2008 & 1998.

- This shows a tighter range of price movement in 1998, with much larger variance in 2008.

- A further study could delve into the likelihood of price movement per month, while using additional years for less bias within the analysis.

- Fin.
